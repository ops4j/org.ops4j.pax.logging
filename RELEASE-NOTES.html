    <h1>Release Notes - Pax Logging - Version 1.2.0</h1>
    <p>
        For this project, compatibility is defined as;
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>No changes to method signatures of any of the classes in the API. Only new methods may appear. Note that
            this may break compatibility with additional Pax Logging implementations, but that is outside the
            compatibility scope.
        </li>
        <li>The configuration system used, whereby a Configuration object either contains the URL or file reference to
            the Log4j configuration, OR that the Configuration instance itself contains the Log4j configuration in its
            properties format.
        </li>
        <li>Pax Logging version 1.x will depend on JDK1.4</li>
        <li>That we are and will remain compatible with the following Legacy APIs, to the greatest extent possible;
        <ul>
            <li>Apache Log4j, version 1.2.15</li>
            <li>Apache Jakarta Commons Logging, version 1.1</li>
