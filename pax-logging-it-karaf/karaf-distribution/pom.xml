                    karaf-maven-plugin defines 3 "stages" related 1:1 with Maven scopes:
                     - <scope>compile</scope>  : stage = Startup
                     - <scope>runtime</scope>  : stage = Boot
                     - <scope>provided</scope> : stage = Installed
                    These stages are "implemented" using different Karaf files:
                     - Startup stage: etc/startup.properties - startup features, startup profiles, startup bundles
                       are used to prepare list of bundles to include in etc/startup.properties
                     - Boot stage: etc/org.apache.karaf.features.cfg - manages features available in featuresBoot
                       property and repositories in featuresRepositories property
                     - Install stage: just installs the artifacts in ${karaf.home}/${karaf.default.repository}
                    And finally there are 5 kinds of artifacts that may be declared to belong to one of 3 stages:
                     - <stage>Bundles
                     - <stage>Features
                     - <stage>Profiles
                     - <stage>PropertiesFile
                     - <stage>Repositories
