<p>The org.apache.log4j.db package provides means to append logging events 
into various databases. The persisted data can be later read back using
{@link org.apache.log4j.receivers.db.DBReceiver}.
</p>

<p>Most popular database systems, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, DB2 and MsSQL
are supported.
</p>

<p>Just as importantly, the way for obtaining JDBC connections is pluggable. Connections can
be obtained through the traditional way of DriverManager, or alternatively as a DataSource.
A DataSource can be instantiated directly or it can obtained through JNDI.
